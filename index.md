# Hey, I’m Seb
## I like to make stuff

I’m a self-taught programmer building applications for cutting edge AI models. I think this technology will be incredibly impactful and every day I wake up with new ideas to try. As a lifelong musician my work so far has mostly involved audio, but I’m interested in every type of model and am currently working on an LLM project.
